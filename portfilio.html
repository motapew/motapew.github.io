                <h3>value</h3>
                <p>There are a lot of ways to value a business. There's no "right" way, though you could probably come up with several wrong ones. Ultimately, the business is worth whatever you think it's worth, based on the criteria you set forth. But you can make your estimation by using several different ways to value the business and then choosing the mix that reflects your final value estimate.</p>

                <p>A common business goal is to run a profitable operation, which typically means increasing revenue while limiting expenses. Revenue objectives could consist of increasing annual sales by 10 percent or landing three new accounts each month. Expense objectives could involve finding a new operating facility that decreases your rent by $200 a month or cutting monthly utility bills by 15 percent.</p>

                <p>A marketing strategy identifies the best target markets for the business based on product or services, including the methods it should use to achieve goals, while staying within budget. It outlines the company’s strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats, and presents clear tactics to handle each.
